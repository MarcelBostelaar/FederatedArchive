# TODO
- [x] rework edition revision and autogen signals (documentation as well) based on the activity diagrams
- [x] Map out signals for when items get created
- [] Test all signals
- [] revise generation config somehow, since it now only does one file format to the next
- [] Implement 1 dummy generation functionality
- [] Implement api
- [] Implement download jobs


## Not MVC
- [] Diff view for text files
- [] Add to fileformat if its a text format
- [] Job to recheck everything in db (for what exactly?)
- [] periodically check remotes
- [] Add hash to files + revision for validating nothing in the remote was changed secretly

## Frontend
- [] abstract document, edition, revision and file need to get their own human readable autogenerated name, not synched, which is where the items are served from, in addition to a uuid based lookup which returns the same files for the api
- [] extra table outside main app for redirecting old urls to new editions/files
