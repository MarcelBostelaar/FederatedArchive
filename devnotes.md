# TODO
- [] rework edition revision and autogen signals (documentation as well) based on the activity diagrams
- [] revise generation config somehow, since it now only does one file format to the next
- [] Map out signals for when items get created
- [] last_checkin periodic lookup, configurable
- [] Add hash to files + revision

## Not MVC
- [] Diff view for text files
- [] Add to fileformat if its a text format
- [] Job to recheck everything in db (for what exactly?)

## Frontend
- [] abstract document, edition, revision and file need to get their own human readable autogenerated name, not synched, which is where the items are served from, in addition to a uuid based lookup which returns the same files for the api
- [] extra table outside main app for redirecting old urls to new editions/files
