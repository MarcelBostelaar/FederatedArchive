# TODO
- [x] rework edition revision and autogen signals (documentation as well) based on the activity diagrams
- [x] Map out signals for when items get created
- [x] Move example plugin to its own app
- [x] Add original filename back to archive file item
- [x] Fix file format logic in generator runner
- [x] Add status remoterequestable
- [ ] Test all signals
- [x] revise generation config somehow, since it now only does one file format to the next
- [x] Implement 1 dummy generation functionality
- [x] Implement api
- [ ] Implement download jobs
  - [] Check that scheduled remote jobs are finished when syncing


## Not MVP
- [ ] Diff view for text files
- [ ] Add to fileformat if its a text format
- [ ] Job to recheck everything in db (for what exactly?)
- [ ] periodically check remotes
- [ ] Add hash to files + revision for validating nothing in the remote was changed secretly

## Frontend
- [ ] abstract document, edition, revision and file need to get their own human readable autogenerated name, not synched, which is where the items are served from, in addition to a uuid based lookup which returns the same files for the api
- [ ] extra table outside main app for redirecting old urls to new editions/files


# Old Roadmap

## Backend
- [x] Basic archive system, with multiple editions per archival ID (book, publication, etc)
