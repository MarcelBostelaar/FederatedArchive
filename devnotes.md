# TODO
- [] make sure to check "autoregen" setting before queuing auto gen job
- [] revise autogen config somehow, since it now only does one file format to the next
- [] add signals to auto gen config
- [] Map out new item signals
- [] abstract document, edition, revision and file need to get their own human readable autogenerated name, not synched, which is where the items are served from, in addition to a uuid based lookup which returns the same files for the api
- [] last_checkin periodic lookup, configurable
- [] Add hash to files + revision
- [] Diff view for text files
- [] Job to recheck everything in db
- [] extra table outside main app for redirecting old urls to new editions/files
