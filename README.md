# FederatedArchive

Software for maintaining an archive of documents in arbitrary formats, in a federative manner. This software allows your instance to link up to other instances and also provide their files in your site as viewable, downloadable and searchable entities. The software allows for easy cloning, mirroring and forking of itself to ensure its continued existance. This software allows people to adopt changes in other repositories as their own.
